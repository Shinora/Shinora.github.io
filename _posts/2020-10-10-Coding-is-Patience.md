Hey, while i am wrinting thoses words, i am struggling with my website integration.
I mean i pushed it dozens of time in order to see new error messages and correct them right away.
This is very frustrating first of all because it means i don't get it all and i use some pieces of code i don't completely understand.
Understanding is the key. But as some people said to me, it will come with practice ... I hope so !
Anyway this is only a test post to see if everything is in order.
It was my first touch with Travis CI and i gotta say it is a very powerful tool.
We will see with time how jekyll is going and if what it can offer are good enough for the use i need.
Anyway despite the fact i had a hard time integrating those two, i am glad i learnt more about them and i am eager to learn even more and more about new techs. When i will have the website working well, i am going to work fully on the style, with css and some javascript to make it a little bit easier to read and also a little less ugly. When writing thoses words it looks like one of the first websites created but with the amazing techs which were build from this time, i should give the website a brand new look in a few minutes.
Thank you for ( or not ) reading, have a good evening !

Simon

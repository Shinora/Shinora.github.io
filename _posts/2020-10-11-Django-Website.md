I started a new Django project today. Never had experience with django before and i kinda got lost in all the file but

Update : Today is the 16/11/2020 so i started my django project a month ago. It start to look like something, i have added a few pages, some css and even managed to deploy it. I deployed it first to eu.pythonanywhere.com but i needed to pay in order to add a custom url.
As the website was meant to be used by my school i wanted to have something easier to type.
I used the ressources offered by the github scholar pack which provided me a free heroku website, two custom urls and a bunch of other stuff.
What did i learn until now over this project :
  - How does a webpage work and how to deploy a website to the web
  - How django works  ( overall ) and what is possible to build with it ( the anwser is ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING !)
  - I learnt how to create models and manage a database
  - I learn how to use css ( at least some basics )
  - It may sound ridiculous but i learnt to search on stackoverflow and debug my code which had like a ton of bugs, fixed one by one.

Ill do a little conclusion aven if the project or the app is far from finished: django is an amazing python framework and quite easy to use.
It can be very powerful and the options are unlimited. Deploying is a pain. This is not over and you will hear from me soon.

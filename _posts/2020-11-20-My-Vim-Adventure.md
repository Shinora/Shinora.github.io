Hey you guys, the other day i ran on a twitch live from beginbot and the guy was using neovim really well. I never saw the editor in action i was shocked ... 
How could this guy type 10 functions per minute ? I found the process quite cool so yeah i decided i was going to give it a shot. I am writing this with vim btw even if that's 
pure text so it isn't very intersting to do it with vim ... 
Anyway ill learn to use it i think i seems fun. AND it's open source ! Ow god i am going crazy with open source ... 
Ill give updates on my vim learning process on here, so ... if you are interested come back ^^

It's been a while since last post, ill try to write more because that's a good thing for me. It help me see what i wanted to achieve 
at a t time and what changed in between, what i accomplished since last time etc... 
Today i want to write in here my tech related goals for the year, i want to put a lot but my studies keep me quite busy so ill try not to set myself too much goals or impossible ones because i would feel completely useless if i can't do all of it ( i won't achieve all of the goals for sure ). 

- First of all i want to learn more abour microcontrollers, learn to do cool stuff with them, it implies:
    - Learn some C programming ( sweating hard )
    - Learn some electronics and hardware ( because i suck at it )
    - Learn how microcontrollers work, clocks and all that stuff i don't understand
This is for sure gonna be a Blog post on itself in wich ill tell my embedded path and how it's going. 

- Learn more about linux in general ( i love it so much but don't know either how it works or how to use it properly ):
    - I wanna switch distro ( currently using ubuntu gnome but don't like it that much ) but kinda scared to move to arch,
        maybe ill just set up a cool majaro i3 setup.
    - Learn linux commands and some shell scripting too 
    - I want to make my own rice, idk why but seems soo cool to have a fully customised desktop and beautifull ( i will surely end up copying a cool 
    desktop from /r unixporn )
That's gonna be all for this but there is a looot of work in the shell thing, i am far far away from mastering linux and shell. 

- Some programming, but some real programming, not just use an API and make some calls to do something that works:
    - Learning maybe another language because Python is cool but i don't get how it works under the hood so i can't optimize anything and my programs are slooow. I am thinking C++ ( ill do some C with microcontrollers ) or Golang, Rust ... Idk for now il lsee later 
    
- Build a better understanding of networking, of hardware, computers and just some : "How do that thing works ?" in general.
I would call that some nerd culture but more deeply, that will for sur ehelp me understand better a lot of what i do.

- Maybe learn to use vim but that's the topic of another blog post ( haven't started yet ) or neovim or a quick, light, configurable editor.

Man that's a lot of objectives and i hope ill be able to do a single on of thouses things, that would be so cool ! 
Have a nice day !

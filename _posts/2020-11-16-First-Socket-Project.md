This is the begining of a new project. Today is the day i got the idea of the project ill work on for the next few weeks : i want to use a socket connection to connect to a mobile game i play and collect
some data that i could organise and analyse.
Here are a few steps i think ill need:

  - Learn more about sockets, protocols and how data is transmited from server to client
  - Install a free android emulator
  - Analyse packets with a dedicated soft ( ex : wireshark )
  - Understand how data is sent in the app
  - Build my own client
  - Build the script that will make data readable
  - gather data on the app
  - Organise and Analyze the extracted data

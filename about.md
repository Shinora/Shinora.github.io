Hey you folks, did you just clicked on this for real ? 
So i am a French Student, 18 years old. 
I study to become an embedded ingineer ( ill become one in 2025 if everything goes well )
I started to do some html and jss juste before to enter high school and then i picked python.
I have done or at least tried to do a bunch of stuff and almost none of it was ever finished but that's not very important. 
My hobbies are programming of course, i like electronics and would like to do it more but man that's hard ... 
I also listen to music, read and a lot of other things i don't do enough to be called hobbies. 
Well, ... That's it, its me !
